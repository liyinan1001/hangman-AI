Compile:
Change to current directory, then run in terminal `g++ ./*.cpp -o output -lcurl`

Run:
play it by `./output`
it will print the result of every play and the target sentence

Logic of this program:
It uses naive bayes to infer each word of the sentence. So it doesn't exploit the order of words. 
It uses a word frequency list from http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt



Tested in Mac OS 10.11
